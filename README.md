# OP-TEE Digital Wallet Example

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a digital wallet using [OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment)](https://www.op-tee.org/), which is built on **Arm TrustZone** technology. OP-TEE allows for the secure execution of trusted applications (TAs) in an isolated environment, separate from the normal operating system.

In this example, a simple digital wallet is implemented with support for secure deposit and withdrawal operations using the OP-TEE framework.

## 🔒 Key Features

- Securely store and manage wallet balance within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- Support for deposit and withdrawal operations via Trusted Application
- Communication between host and TA using OP-TEE APIs
- Demonstrates secure computing with **Arm TrustZone**
  
## 🛠️ Requirements

- OP-TEE build environment set up (e.g., QEMU or ARM development board)
- [repo tool](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/)
- ARM toolchain for cross-compilation
- Familiarity with building and running OP-TEE examples

## 🚀 How to Build & Run

2. Clone this repository into the `build` directory of OP-TEE.
3. Include this example in your `Makefile` or `manifest.xml` for OP-TEE.
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
5. Run on QEMU or your target board:
